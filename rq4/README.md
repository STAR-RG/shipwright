# Effectiveness of shipwright (submitting real pull requests!)

## Too Long Didn't Read (TLDR)

We provide a breakdown of the pull requests we submitted and whether (at the current date---Jan 21st, 2021) these requests are accepted/rejected/or still pending. From this raw data one can directly reproduce the numbers we use in our paper related to pull request acceptance. (Note: there's been one new rejection since submission---the camera ready will reflect this, and any other changes that occur prior to the camera ready deadline.)

## Details

```
How effective is shipwright in reducing the number of broken Dockerfiles in public repositories?
```

With this question we set out to understand whether shipwright, as a tool for automated Dockerfile repair, could be used to make real pull requests and help real developers improve their broken Dockerfiles. A detailed breakdown of our efforts is given below.
