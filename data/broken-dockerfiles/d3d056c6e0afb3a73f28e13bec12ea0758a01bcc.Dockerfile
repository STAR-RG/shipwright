# SOFTWARE PACKAGES
#   * musl: standard C library
#   * lib6-compat: compatibility libraries for glibc
#   * linux-headers: commonly needed, and an unusual package name from Alpine.
#   * build-base: used so we include the basic development packages (gcc)
#   * bash: so we can access /bin/bash
#   * git: to ease up clones of repos
#   * ca-certificates: for SSL verification during Pip and easy_install
#   * freetype: library used to render text onto bitmaps, and provides support font-related operations
#   * libgfortran: contains a Fortran shared library, needed to run Fortran
#   * libgcc: contains shared code that would be inefficient to duplicate every time as well as auxiliary helper routines and runtime support
#   * libstdc++: The GNU Standard C++ Library. This package contains an additional runtime library for C++ programs built with the GNU compiler
#   * openblas: open source implementation of the BLAS(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) API with many hand-crafted optimizations for specific processor types
#   * tcl: scripting language
#   * tk: GUI toolkit for the Tcl scripting language
#   * libssl1.0: SSL shared libraries
