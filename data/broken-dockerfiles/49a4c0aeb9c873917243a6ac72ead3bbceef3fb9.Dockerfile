# to use the Debian package manager, due to issues with syncing libicu
# dependencies.

# Install additional Python dependencies for the PythonInterop sample.
# Note that QuTiP has as a hard requirement that its dependencies must be
# installed first, so we separate into two pip install steps.

# building QuTiP can take a few moments. This makes it easier if we want to add
# other Python packages later.
