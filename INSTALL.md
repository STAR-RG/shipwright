# Installation

Cloning the git repository gives you our data and tools. We assume you have a working installation of Docker to use this artifact (see `REQUIREMENTS.md`).

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/STAR-RG/shipwright

cd ./shipwright

**Note:** when we give example commands and instruction, we assume you are working in the root directory of the `shipwright` git repository.
