We would like to apply for the Reusable and Available badges:

We have made our artifact available on GitHub.

We have provided both the dependencies for running our tools (via Docker) and documentation (in this repository)

We have setup the artifact to run some of our experiments (minus the original data collection) and to produce results in an easily understandable and usable form.

We have include all of our data and the tools we built to transform and analyze this data, to allow others to jump-start their own work in this area. In particular, we include raw build results from over 20,000 Dockerfile builds: this represents a significant investment of compute that others, who build on this, will not have to undertake themselves.
